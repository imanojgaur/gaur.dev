## Overview

DAP360 is an ongoing full-stack e-commerce project designed to handle real-world plant sales. I am building this from scratch to master complex database architectures, global state management, and secure user sessions.

## Core Features (In Development)

- **Role-Based Authentication**: Implementing secure user and admin login flows using NextAuth.js.
- **Relational Data Modeling**: Designing a scalable PostgreSQL schema via Prisma to efficiently handle products, users, cart sessions, and orders.
- **Global State Management**: Utilizing Zustand to handle complex client-side cart logic without unnecessary component re-renders.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Zustand
- **Backend:** Node.js, Next.js Server Actions
- **Database:** PostgreSQL managed via Prisma ORM
- **Security:** NextAuth.js

## Current Focus & Architecture

Since the project is in its foundational phase, my primary focus is on backend architecture. The biggest challenge right now is designing a robust relational database schema to avoid N+1 query issues later, and setting up secure server actions before scaling the frontend UI.

## Status

Currently in active development.
